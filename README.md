# 😺 CATJ! Catch your cat's feelings! ❤️
CATJ is a specialized app dedicated to enhancing cat mental health through structured journaling and care management. Cats, like humans, thrive on routine and emotional well-being, but their needs can often be overlooked in the hustle of daily life. This app addresses the critical aspect of tracking a cat's habits, health, and behaviors to promote overall wellness and strengthen the bond between cats and their owners.

Built with PostgreSQL, Prisma, Next.js, CATJ Journal offers a fast, intuitive, and responsive platform. The app serves as a digital diary where cat owners can log daily observations, feeding times, play activities, and any notable behavioral changes. By consistently documenting these details, users can identify patterns and address potential health or mental well-being issues early.

Imagine a _Pokimon_ game, but with your actual cats!
