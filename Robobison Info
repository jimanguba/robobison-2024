# Robobisons Open Project Showcase

Undergraduate students may form up to a team of 3 to submit a CS-related project (software, library, game, webapp, research, etc.) of their own choosing. Any project, regardless of when it was started or finished, is fair game as long as the students were heavily involved in its development process. 

The winners will get **fully funded** to attend the **Canadian University Software Engineering Conference (CUSEC) 2025** to submit their project and participate in the **Dev's Den contest**, representing the University of Manitoba on one of the biggest stages for undergraduate students across Canada.

## üèÜ Prize for the Best Team
- Up to **$3000** for a team of 3 ($1000 per person).
- The prize money is strictly for expenses related to attending CUSEC (conference tickets, plane tickets, accommodation, food, drink, and travel fees for the duration of CUSEC).
- In cases where the winning group has fewer than 3 representatives, or additional funding is received, the second-best team may be eligible for partial or full funding.

## üìú Requirements
- The project **must** be original work (e.g., no forking someone else‚Äôs GitHub repository and claiming it as yours).
- The project **must** have a working interactive prototype, except for research projects where a poster must be submitted.
- The project **must** be submitted under the names of a maximum of three students (regardless of how many people were involved in its development).
- The project **must** be accompanied by a **maximum** 5-minute video presentation (.mp4 format preferred).
- Submissions are **recommended** to be in the form of a GitHub repository (other forms are acceptable depending on the project type).
- Projects are encouraged to be **creative**, **presentable**, and **solve a real-world problem**. A grading rubric will be provided for participants' transparency.

- Confirm their ability to attend the entirety of **CUSEC** (January 9th - 11th, 2025).
